# My First Repo
[Click here to view my deployed project!] (https://jthomp1993.github.io/my-first-repo/)



I created this project whilst completing the section on the command line interface, git and github. It enabled me to be able to practice using the commands in the terminal, pushing my work up to the main repositiory and also deploying projects so that they are live. 
The technolgies that I used in the project were HTML and CSS. I used these technologies to create a 3 page website which displays a number of different programming languages and platforms that includes their logos and a link to their Wikipedia page. 

Below is a section of HTML code demonstrated by the tutor to create the section about HTML5 on my webpage. 
<h1>Stream One</h1>
<div class="card">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target="_blank"> 
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg/1200px-HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" alt="HTML5"/>
          <h2>HTML5</h2>
      </a>
</div>

In the future I would like to add more information about each item which is displayed on the web page rather than just the name and the logo image. 

During the creation of this project I encountered a couple of problems such as git hub not being able to access the URL of my project when i tried to push it up to the main repository. However I found a quick solution to this by searching on google which happened to be just changing my sections within the access control settings.
